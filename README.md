# Power BI Project: Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer behavior, subscription patterns, payment trends, and usage statistics using a Customer Churn dataset. By leveraging Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard to provide insights into customer demographics, subscription distribution, payment delays, and support interaction patterns. The goal is to help stakeholders understand key trends and identify areas for business improvement.

## Features and Insights

### **1. Customer Overview Section**
- **Gender Distribution**: Analyzed the percentage split between male and female customers, providing a clear understanding of gender demographics.
- **Age Distribution**: Examined how customer ages are distributed, highlighting dominant age groups.
- **Average Tenure**: Calculated the mean duration customers have been associated with the service, offering insights into retention.
- **Tenure by Subscription Type**: Compared average tenure across subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium) to identify trends.

### **2. Subscription and Payment Section**
- **Subscription Distribution**: Visualized the count of customers for each subscription type, uncovering popular choices.
- **Top-Contributing Subscription Type**: Identified which subscription type generates the highest revenue.
- **Payment Delays**: Assessed the number of customers who delayed payments, categorized by delay periods.
- **Payment Trends by Contract Length**: Investigated patterns in payment delays based on contract types (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).

### **3. Usage and Support Section**
- **Usage Frequency**: Determined the average frequency of customer usage across the dataset.
- **High Usage Groups**: Pinpointed customer groups (based on age, subscription type, and contract length) with the highest usage frequency.
- **Support Calls Analysis**: Highlighted customers with the most support interactions, helping identify areas for customer service enhancement.
- **Support Calls vs. Payment Delays**: Explored potential correlations between the number of support calls and payment delays.

## Key Visualizations
- Pie charts for gender and subscription distribution.
- Bar graphs for age and tenure analysis.
- Heatmaps for payment delays and support call correlations.
- Line charts to analyze trends over time for tenure and payments.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **Dataset**: Customer Churn dataset, including customer details, subscription data, payment history, and support records.

## Conclusion
This dashboard offers actionable insights into customer behavior and business trends. The visualizations make it easier for stakeholders to identify pain points, optimize retention strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.
